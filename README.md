# EOS Connect

EOS Connect is a tool designed to optimize energy usage by interacting with the EOS system. It fetches energy data, processes it, and displays the results dynamically on a webpage.

## Features
* Fetches energy or battery data from OpenHAB or HomeAssistant.
* Processes data to create a load profile.
* Interacts with the Tibber API and PV forecast API.
* Manages configurations via a user-friendly config.yaml file.
* Displays results dynamically on a webpage.
* Future plans include controlling FRONIUS inverters and battery charging systems interactively.

## Current Status
This project is in its early stages and is actively being developed and enhanced.

### Compatibility Notes:

* Hint 1: Compatible with the latest EOS (new API) by default.
* Hint 2: For older EOS versions [EOS commit e22388b](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS/tree/e22388b7537af545a53d6cebef35d98a7ee30e1b), modify the create_optimize_request("old") function.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation and Running

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

Pull existing latest snapshot and run the application in the background using Docker Compose (`--pull always` ensures the latest image is pulled):
   ```
   docker-compose up --pull always -d
   ```

### Using in Home Assistant with an Add On

see https://github.com/ohAnd/ha_addons

### Local

#### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EOS_connect
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages (for local usage):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
#### Running Locally

Run the application locally without Docker, you can execute the following command:
```
python src/eos_connect.py
```

## Configuration

Configuration is described here [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md)

## Usage

The application will start fetching energy data from OpenHAB or HomeAssistant and processing it according to the defined logic in `src/eos_connect.py`. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8081`. For local usage the port is configurable see [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md). For docker usage change the mapped port in docker-compose.yml.
