# EOS Connect

Request optimization at an [EOS](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS) and handle the response to display the result on a dynamic webpage.

Currently, the project is designed to fetch energy data from OpenHAB, process it, and create a load profile. It includes functionalities for interacting with the Tibber API and PV forecast API, managing configurations, and handling energy data.

Next step:
Using the feedback to interactively control a FRONIUS inverter and battery charging system.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EOS_connect
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages (for local usage):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t eos_connect .
   ```

2. Run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Running Locally

```
python src/eos_connect.py
```

## Configuration

Configuration is described here [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md)

## Usage

The application will start fetching energy data from OpenHAB and processing it according to the defined logic in `src/eos_connect.py`. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8081`.
