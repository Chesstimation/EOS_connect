# EOS Connect

EOS Connect is a tool designed to optimize energy usage by interacting with the EOS system. It fetches energy data, processes it, and displays the results dynamically on a webpage.

## Features
* Fetches energy or battery data from OpenHAB or HomeAssistant.
* Processes data to create a load profile.
* Interacts with the Tibber API and PV forecast API.
* Manages configurations via a user-friendly config.yaml file.
* Displays results dynamically on a webpage.
* Future plans include controlling FRONIUS inverters and battery charging systems interactively.

## Current Status
This project is in its early stages and is actively being developed and enhanced.

### Compatibility Notes:

* Hint 1: Compatible with the latest EOS (new API) by default.
* Hint 2: For older EOS versions [EOS commit e22388b](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS/tree/e22388b7537af545a53d6cebef35d98a7ee30e1b), modify the create_optimize_request("old") function.

```
python src/eos_connect.py
```

## Configuration

Configuration is described here [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md)

## Usage

The application will start fetching energy data from OpenHAB and processing it according to the defined logic in `src/eos_connect.py`. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8081`.
