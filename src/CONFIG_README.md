# Configuration

This document provides an overview of the configuration settings for the application. The configuration settings are stored in a `config.yaml` file.  
A default config file will be created with the first start, if there is no `config.yaml` in the `src` folder.

*Hint: There are different combinations of parameters possible. If there is a problem with missing or incorrect configuration, it will be shown in the logs as an error.*

### PV Forecast Configuration

This section contains two subsections:
- `pv_forecast_source`
- `pv_forecast`

**Important:** All supported PV forecast providers (akkudoktor, openmeteo, openmeteo_local, forecast_solar, evcc) use the same azimuth convention where **0° = South** and **negative values = East**. No conversion is needed when switching between providers.

`pv_forecast_source` section declares the provider of solar forecast that should be used. Available providers are
- `akkudoktor` - https://api.akkudoktor.net/ - direct request and results
- `openmeteo` - https://open-meteo.com/en/docs - uses the [open-meteo-solar-forecast](https://github.com/rany2/open-meteo-solar-forecast) (no horizon possible by the lib at this time)
- `openmeteo_local` - https://open-meteo.com/en/docs - gathering radiation and cloudcover data and calculating locally with an own model - still in dev to improve the calculation
- `forecast_solar` - https://doc.forecast.solar/api - direct request and results
- `solcast` - https://solcast.com/ - high-precision solar forecasting using satellite data and machine learning models. Requires creating a rooftop site in your Solcast account and using the resource_id (not location coordinates). Free API key provides up to 10 calls per day.
- `evcc` - retrieves forecasts from an existing EVCC installation via API - requires EVCC section to be configured
default is uses akkudoktor

**Temperature Forecasts**: EOS Connect also fetches temperature forecasts to improve optimization accuracy, as temperature affects battery efficiency and energy consumption patterns. When using provider-specific configurations (akkudoktor, openmeteo, etc.), temperature data is automatically retrieved using the same geographical coordinates. When using EVCC, localized temperature forecasts require at least one PV configuration entry with coordinates.

`pv_forecast` section allows you to define multiple PV forecast entries, each distinguished by a user-given name. Below is an example of a default PV forecast configuration:

```yaml
pv_forecast_source:
  source: akkudoktor # data source for solar forecast providers akkudoktor, openmeteo, openmeteo_local, forecast_solar, evcc, solcast, default (default uses akkudoktor)
  api_key: "" # API key for Solcast (required only when source is 'solcast')
pv_forecast:
  - name: myPvInstallation1  # User-defined identifier for the PV installation, must be unique if you use multiple installations
    lat: 47.5  # Latitude for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    lon: 8.5  # Longitude for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    azimuth: 90.0  # Azimuth for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    tilt: 30.0  # Tilt for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    power: 4600  # Power for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    powerInverter: 5000  # Power Inverter for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    inverterEfficiency: 0.9  # Inverter Efficiency for PV forecast @ Akkudoktor API
    horizon: 10,20,10,15  # Horizon to calculate shading, up to 360 values to describe the shading situation for your PV.
    resource_id: "" # Resource ID for Solcast (required only when source is 'solcast')
```

#### Parameters
- **`name`**:  
  A user-defined identifier for the PV installation. Must be unique if you use multiple installations.

- **`lat`**:  
  Latitude for the PV forecast.

- **`lon`**:  
  Longitude for the PV forecast.

- **`azimuth`**:  
  Azimuth angle for the PV forecast in degrees. **All supported forecast providers use the same solar/PV industry standard convention:**
  - **0° = South** (optimal orientation for Northern Hemisphere)
  - **90° = West**
  - **180° = North** 
  - **-90° = East** (negative values for east-facing)
  
  **Example orientations:** A south-facing roof would use `azimuth: 0`, while a garage facing southeast would use `azimuth: -45`, and a carport facing west would use `azimuth: 90`. An east-facing installation would use `azimuth: -90`.

- **`tilt`**:  
  Tilt angle for the PV forecast.

- **`power`**:  
  The power of the PV installation, in watts (W).

- **`powerInverter`**:  
  The power of the inverter, in watts (W).

- **`inverterEfficiency`**:  
  The efficiency of the inverter, as a decimal value between `0` and `1`.

- **`horizon`**:  
  (Optional) A list of up to 36 values describing the shading situation for the PV installation. The list always covers 360° – 4 entries will represent 90° steps, e.g.
  - 10,20,10,15 – 0–90° is shadowed if sun elevation is below 10°, and so on.
  - 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,70,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 – 18 entries → 20° steps; here, 180°–200° requires 50° of sun elevation, otherwise the panel is shadowed.

- **`resource_id`**:  
  (Solcast only) The resource ID from your Solcast rooftop site configuration. Required when using Solcast as the PV forecast source. Not used by other providers.


**Special Configuration for Solcast:**

When using `source: solcast`, the configuration requirements are different:

- **`api_key`** (in `pv_forecast_source`): Required. Your Solcast API key obtained from your Solcast account.
- **`resource_id`** (in each `pv_forecast` entry): Required. The resource ID from your Solcast rooftop site configuration.
- **Location parameters for temperature forecasts**: While `azimuth`, `tilt`, and `horizon` are configured in your Solcast dashboard and ignored by EOS Connect, **`lat` and `lon` are still required** for fetching temperature forecasts that EOS needs for accurate optimization calculations.
- **`power`, `powerInverter`, `inverterEfficiency`**: Still required for system scaling and efficiency calculations.

**Setting up Solcast:**
1. Create a free account at [solcast.com](https://solcast.com/)
2. Configure a "Rooftop Site" with your PV system details (location, tilt, azimuth, capacity)
3. Copy the Resource ID from your rooftop site
4. Get your API key from the account settings
5. Use these values in your EOS Connect configuration (including lat/lon for temperature forecasts)

---

### Inverter Configuration

- **`inverter.type`**:  
  Specifies the type of inverter. Possible values:  
  - `fronius_gen24`: Use the Fronius Gen24 inverter (enhanced V2 interface with firmware-based authentication for all firmware versions).
  - `fronius_gen24_legacy`: Use the Fronius Gen24 inverter (legacy V1 interface for corner cases).
  - `evcc`: Use the universal interface via evcc external battery control (evcc config below has to be valid).
  - `default`: Disable inverter control (only display the target state).

- **`inverter.address`**:  
  The IP address of the inverter. (only needed for fronius_gen24/fronius_gen24_legacy)

- **`inverter.user`**:  
  The username for the inverter's local portal. (only needed for fronius_gen24/fronius_gen24_legacy)

- **`inverter.password`**:  
  The password for the inverter's local portal. (only needed for fronius_gen24/fronius_gen24_legacy)
  
  **Note for enhanced interface**: The default `fronius_gen24` interface automatically detects your firmware version and uses the appropriate authentication method. If you recently updated your inverter firmware to 1.38.6-1+ or newer, you may need to reset your password in the WebUI (http://your-inverter-ip/) under Settings -> User Management. New firmware versions require password reset after updates to enable the improved encryption method.

- **`inverter.max_grid_charge_rate`**:  
  The maximum grid charge rate, in watts (W). Limitation for calculating the target grid charge power and for EOS inverter model. (currently not supported by evcc external battery control, but shown and calculated - reachable per **EOS connect** API)

- **`inverter.max_pv_charge_rate`**:  
  The maximum PV charge rate, in watts (W). Limitation for calculating the target pv charge power and for EOS inverter model. (currently not supported by evcc external battery control, but shown and calculated - reachable per **EOS connect** API)

---

### EVCC Configuration

- **`evcc.url`**:  
  The URL for the EVCC instance (e.g., `http://<ip>:7070`). If not used set to `url: ""` or leave as `url: http://yourEVCCserver:7070`

**Note**: When using `evcc` as the `pv_forecast_source`, this EVCC configuration must be properly configured. EOS Connect will retrieve PV forecasts directly from the EVCC API instead of using individual PV installation configurations. In this case, the `pv_forecast` section can be left empty or minimal, as EVCC provides the aggregated forecast data.

---

### MQTT Configuration

### Example: Using EVCC for PV Forecasts

When using EVCC as your PV forecast source, the configuration is simplified as EVCC provides the aggregated forecast data:

```yaml
# PV forecast source configuration - using EVCC
pv_forecast_source:
  source: evcc # Use EVCC for PV forecasts
pv_forecast:
  - name: "Location for Temperature" # At least one entry needed for temperature forecasts
    lat: 47.5 # Required for temperature forecasts used by EOS optimization
    lon: 8.5 # Required for temperature forecasts used by EOS optimization
    # Other parameters (azimuth, tilt, power, etc.) not used for PV forecasts but can be included
# EVCC configuration - REQUIRED when using evcc as pv_forecast_source
evcc:
  url: http://192.168.1.100:7070  # URL to your EVCC installation
```

In this configuration:
- EVCC handles all PV installation details and provides aggregated forecasts
- The `pv_forecast` section requires at least one entry with valid `lat` and `lon` coordinates for temperature forecasts that EOS needs for accurate optimization
- The `evcc.url` must point to a reachable EVCC instance with API access enabled
- Temperature forecasts are essential for EOS optimization calculations, regardless of PV forecast source

### Example: Using Solcast for PV Forecasts

When using Solcast as your PV forecast source, you need to configure your rooftop sites in the Solcast dashboard first:

```yaml
# PV forecast source configuration - using Solcast
pv_forecast_source:
  source: solcast # Use Solcast for PV forecasts
  api_key: "your_solcast_api_key_here" # Your Solcast API key (required)

# PV forecast configurations using Solcast resource IDs
pv_forecast:
  - name: "Main Roof South"
    resource_id: "abcd-efgh-1234-5678" # Resource ID from Solcast dashboard
    lat: 47.5 # Required for temperature forecasts used by EOS optimization
    lon: 8.5 # Required for temperature forecasts used by EOS optimization
    power: 5000 # Still needed for system scaling
    powerInverter: 5000
    inverterEfficiency: 0.95
    # azimuth, tilt, horizon not used for PV forecasts - configured in Solcast dashboard
  - name: "Garage East"
    resource_id: "ijkl-mnop-9999-0000" # Different resource ID for second installation
    lat: 47.5 # Same location coordinates can be used for multiple installations
    lon: 8.5
    power: 2500
    powerInverter: 3000
    inverterEfficiency: 0.92
```

**Important Solcast Rate Limiting Information:**

- Each PV installation requires a separate rooftop site configured in your Solcast account
- Physical PV parameters (tilt, azimuth) are configured in the Solcast dashboard, not in EOS Connect
- **Location coordinates (lat, lon) are still required** for temperature forecasts that EOS uses for optimization calculations
- The `resource_id` is obtained from your Solcast rooftop site configuration
- `power`, `powerInverter`, and `inverterEfficiency` are still required for proper system scaling
- **Free Solcast accounts are limited to 10 API calls per day**
- **EOS Connect automatically extends update intervals to 2.5 hours when using Solcast** to stay within the 10 calls/day limit (9.6 calls/day actual usage)
- Multiple PV installations will result in multiple API calls per update cycle - consider this when planning your configuration
- If you exceed rate limits, EOS Connect will use the previous forecast data until the next successful API call
