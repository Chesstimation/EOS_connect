"""
This module provides the `BatteryInterface` class, which serves as an interface for fetching 
the State of Charge (SOC) data of a battery from various sources such as OpenHAB and Home Assistant.
The `BatteryInterface` class allows users to configure the source of SOC data and retrieve the 
current SOC value through its methods. It supports fetching SOC data from OpenHAB using its REST API 
and from Home Assistant using its API with authentication.
Classes:
    - BatteryInterface: A class to interact with SOC data sources and retrieve battery SOC.
Dependencies:
    - logging: For logging information, warnings, and errors.
    - requests: For making HTTP requests to the SOC data sources.
Usage:
    Create an instance of the `BatteryInterface` class by providing the source, URL,
    sensor identifier, and access token (if required). Use the `battery_get_current_soc` method to
    fetch the current SOC value.
Example:
    ```python
    battery_interface = BatteryInterface(
        src="openhab",
        url="http://openhab-server",
        soc_sensor="BatterySOC",
        access_token=None
    current_soc = battery_interface.battery_get_current_soc()
    print(f"Current SOC: {current_soc}%")
    ```

    BatteryInterface is a class that provides an interface for fetching the State of Charge (SOC)

    Attributes:
        src (str): The source of the SOC data. Can be "default", "openhab", or "homeassistant".
        url (str): The base URL of the SOC data source.
        soc_sensor (str): The identifier of the SOC sensor in the data source.
        access_token (str): The access token for authentication (used for Home Assistant).
    Methods:
