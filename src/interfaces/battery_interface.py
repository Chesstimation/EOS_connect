This module provides the `BatteryInterface` class, which serves as an interface for fetching
the State of Charge (SOC) data of a battery from various sources such as OpenHAB and Home Assistant.
The `BatteryInterface` class allows users to configure the source of SOC data and retrieve the
current SOC value through its methods. It supports fetching SOC data from OpenHAB using its REST API
and from Home Assistant using its API with authentication.
Classes:
    - BatteryInterface: A class to interact with SOC data sources and retrieve battery SOC.
Dependencies:
    - logging: For logging information, warnings, and errors.
    - requests: For making HTTP requests to the SOC data sources.
Usage:
    Create an instance of the `BatteryInterface` class by providing the source, URL,
    sensor identifier, and access token (if required). Use the `battery_request_current_soc`
    method to fetch the current SOC value.
Example:
    ```python
    battery_interface = BatteryInterface(
        src="openhab",
        url="http://openhab-server",
        soc_sensor="BatterySOC",
        access_token=None
    current_soc = battery_interface.battery_request_current_soc()
    print(f"Current SOC: {current_soc}%")
    ```
